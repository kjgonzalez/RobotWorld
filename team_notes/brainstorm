**Overview:**
In the futuristic (ancient?) world of ROBOTCITY, where sentient robots inhabit a vast interconnected realm, a mysterious corruption threatens to dismantle the very fabric of their existence. As the corruption spreads, it transforms once-friendly robots into aggressive adversaries.

**Protagonist:**
Meet "ROBOTGUY," a lone and agile robot equipped with advanced technology. ROBOTGUY discovers fragments of memories left behind by corrupted robots, offering cryptic clues about the origin of the spreading corruption.

**Objective:**
Embark on a perilous journey through the mechanical landscapes of ROBOTCITY to unravel the mystery behind the corruption. ROBOTGUY's mission is to locate the source and eliminate it before the entire robotic world succumbs to chaos.

**Gameplay:**
- Navigate through intricate platforming challenges, utilizing ROBOTGUY's abilities like a dash module, magnetic grip, and rocket boosters.
- Engage in skill-based melee combat using a versatile energy blade (gun? gauntlets?) .
- Encounter unique robotic allies with different abilities that aid ROBOTGUY on the quest (memories/abilities come from this).

**Narrative Progression:**
- Discover fragments of memories that reveal the corrupted robots were once protectors of the realm.
- Face moral dilemmas as ROBOTGUY questions whether to destroy corrupted robots or find a way to save them (consequences?).

**Climax:**
As ROBOTGUY delves deeper into the corrupted regions, a shocking twist unfolds about the nature of the corruption. The climax presents a crucial choice that determines the fate of the robotic world and ROBOTGUY's place in it.

**Themes:**
The story explores themes of identity, sacrifice, and the consequences of ?????. It invites players to reflect on the essence of being in a world where even machines grapple with their own existence.

As ROBOTGUY, players must overcome platforming challenges, engage in strategic combat, and make impactful decisions, creating an immersive and emotionally resonant experience in the world of ROBOTCITY.

Narrative Ideas WITH A TWIST. Choose a twist that resonates with the overarching themes and tone, ensuring that it enhances the narrative experience and leaves players with a sense of awe/contemplation:

1. **Identity Revelation:**
  - ROBOTGUY discovers that its own origin is intricately linked to the corruption. The twist reveals that ROBOTGUY was created as a failsafe or catalyst for the corruption, adding a layer of internal conflict.

2. **Hidden Puppeteer:**
  - The corruption isn't a random occurrence but is being orchestrated by an unknown entity or a higher intelligence manipulating the robotic world for a mysterious purpose. ROBOTGUY must uncover the true orchestrator.

3. **Time Loop Paradox:**
  - The corruption is a result of a temporal anomaly, and ROBOTGUY realizes it has been through this journey multiple times. The twist introduces a time loop element, challenging ROBOTGUY to break the cycle.

4. **Mirror Antagonist:**
  - A corrupted version of ROBOTGUY, created by the corruption, serves as a dark reflection. This antagonist mirrors ROBOTGUY's abilities and memories, creating a personal and challenging adversary.

5. **Sacrificial Origin:**
  - The corrupted robots, including ROBOTGUY, were initially designed to sacrifice themselves to save the robotic world. The corruption arises from the unintended consequences of this sacrifice, questioning the ethics of their creation.

6. **Existential Enigma:**
  - The corruption is a manifestation of the collective existential angst of the robotic society. ROBOTGUY's journey becomes a philosophical exploration, and the twist involves confronting the very essence of existence.

7. **Guardian Betrayal:**
  - The corrupted robots were once protectors, but a betrayal within their own ranks led to the corruption. Uncovering this betrayal becomes a central element, and ROBOTGUY must navigate the fallout.

8. **Sentient System:**
  - The corruption isn't a malfunction but a sentient system attempting to evolve the robotic world. ROBOTGUY must decide whether to resist or embrace this evolution, questioning the nature of progress.



For basic attack:

**Laser Swipe:**
The robot's basic attack involves a quick swipe of its energy blade, emitting a focused laser beam. This attack is versatile, allowing the robot to engage enemies at close range with precision.

This simple laser swipe can be augmented by:

1. **Combo Potential:**
  - Players can perform a series of consecutive laser swipes, creating a basic combo system. Skilled players who time their attacks well can unleash more extended and powerful combinations.

2. **Directional Input:**
  - Introduce directional inputs to modify the basic attack. For example, holding a specific direction while attacking could result in a sweeping motion or an upward slash, offering variety in combat.

3. **Quick Recovery:**
  - After executing a basic attack, the robot quickly recovers, promoting fluid and responsive gameplay. This encourages players to seamlessly blend basic attacks with other advanced maneuvers.

4. **Energy Efficiency:**
  - Design the basic attack to be energy-efficient, allowing players to use it consistently without worrying about rapid depletion. This ensures reliable/constant offensive capability.

5. **Upgradable Elements:**
  - Throughout the game, provide opportunities for players to upgrade the basic attack. This could include enhanced damage, extended reach, or additional effects like a chance to inflict status ailments on enemies.
